Lua provides the following relational operators:
```operators
    <  <=  >  >=  ==  ~=
```
All these operators always result in **true** or **false**

The operator == tests for equality; the operator ~= is the negation of equality.
If the values have different types, Lua considers them different values. Otherwise, Lua compares them according to their types.
Specifically, **nil** is equal only to itself.
Lua compares tables, userdata and functions by reference, that is, two such values are considered equal only if they are the very same object. For instance, after the code
```lua
a = {}; a.x = 1; a.y = 0;
b = {}; b.x = 1; b.y = 0;
c = a;
```
